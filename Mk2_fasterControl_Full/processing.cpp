 * @brief Interrupt Service Routine - Interrupt-Driven Analog Conversion.
 *
 * This ISR is triggered whenever an ADC conversion is completed, approximately every 104 µs

 * and diverted connections, ensuring real-time processing of energy data.
 *
 * @details 
 * An Interrupt Service Routine is now defined which instructs the ADC to perform a conversion
 * for each of the voltage and current sensors in turn.
 *
 * This Interrupt Service Routine is for use when the ADC is in the free-running mode.
 * It is executed whenever an ADC conversion has finished, approx every 104 µs. In
 * free-running mode, the ADC has already started its next conversion by the time that
 * the ISR is executed. The ISR therefore needs to "look ahead".
 *
 * At the end of conversion Type N, conversion Type N+1 will start automatically. The ISR
 * which runs at this point therefore needs to capture the results of conversion Type N,
 * and set up the conditions for conversion Type N+2, and so on.
 *
 * By means of various helper functions, all of the time-critical activities are processed
 * within the ISR.
 *
 * The main code is notified by means of a flag when fresh copies of loggable data are available.
 *
 * @note
 * Guidelines for writing an ISR:
 * - Keep it short and efficient.
 * - Avoid using delay() or serial prints.
 * - Use `volatile` for shared variables.
 * - Protect shared variables with critical sections if necessary.
 * - Avoid enabling or disabling interrupts within the ISR.

/**
 * @brief Initializes optional pins for the old PCB configuration.
 *
 * This function configures various optional pins based on the hardware setup and
 * feature flags. It ensures that the pins are properly initialized for their respective
 * purposes, such as dual tariff, override, priority rotation, diversion, relay diversion,
 * and watchdog functionality.
 *
 * @warning Ensure that the pin assignments are valid for the selected PCB configuration.
 *
 * @details
 * - Configures the dual tariff pin as an input with an internal pull-up resistor.
 * - Configures the override pin as an input with an internal pull-up resistor.
 * - Configures the priority rotation pin as an input with an internal pull-up resistor.
 * - Configures the diversion pin as an input with an internal pull-up resistor.
 * - Initializes relay diversion pins if enabled.
 * - Configures the watchdog pin as an output and sets it to OFF.
